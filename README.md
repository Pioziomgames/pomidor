# Usage:



Get the mds of your model.

Place any additional textures in a folder named "textures" in the same location as your mds.

Open the mds in a text editor and delete everything besides the things you want to add.

So for example if I want to replace yukiko's model I delete all bones that are already in yukiko's original model.



Save your mds and give it to the program using the browse button on the right.



Next in the text box in the middle of the program you input the names of things you want to delete from amd files you're going to replace.

So for example I want replace all of yukiko's body's, so I have to delete it from the original amd's. So I input this into the text box:

By doing this I delete the bone that draws body parts and all the parts that it draws. (spelling matters it has to be exactly the same as in the mds)

If I wanted to delete just one part of the body I would need to delete the body_bone and an edited one to the inputted mds.

Lastly on the left of the program you select the path to a folder with your amd files (I recommend doing a backup of them before running it as the program will overwrite them).

After that you just press start and wait until it's finished.
